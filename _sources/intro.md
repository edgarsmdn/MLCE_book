# Welcome to Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering! ðŸ‘‹

This book is intended to serve as a template/prototype for the hands-on part of a Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering (MLCE) course. 
This was a collective effort between the [Process Systems Engineering group](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/pse)  at the 
Otto von Guericke University / MPI Magdeburg
and the [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/optimisation-and-machine-learning-for-process-engineering/about-us/) 
at Imperial College London to share experiences and material 
used in the respective MLCE courses offered in these institutions.

This book was prepared by [Edgar Sanchez](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/), [Antonio del Rio](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.del-rio-chanona) and 
[Caroline Ganzer](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/126003/1681423) with the help of many collegues. If you have a question or need some 
help in adapting this book to your MLCE course feel free to contact us!
