# Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering

This repo contains the building material for a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)  which is intended to serve as a template/prototype for the hands-on part of a Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering (MLCE) course. This was a collective effort between the [Process Systems Engineering group at the Otto von Guericke University / MPI Magdeburg](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/2316/en) and the [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering group at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/optimisation-and-machine-learning-for-process-engineering/about-us/) to share experiences and material used in the respective MLCE courses offered in these institutions.

### To look at the book üìöüíª go to [this link](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/intro.html)!

## Contents

The book aims at covering application case-studies in chemical engineering of 

- **Supervised learning**
- **Unsupervised learning** 
- **Reinforcement learning** 
- **Data-driven optimization**
- **Hybrid modelling**

## Do you want to contribute?

If you have nice tutorials in the areas mentioned above reflecting case-studies in chemical engineering, we encourage you to share it with the community! üí™ For practical reasons, it is better if you submit your pull-request including a link to a working Colab Notebook.
