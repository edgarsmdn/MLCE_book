    "The problem with constructing a serial hybrid model, as exemplified above, is that the data-driven model cannot be trained independently of the differential equation system that describes the system (mechanistic part of the hybrid model). Actually, the neural network should learn the function $r=f(c)$ but, of course, we do not have values for $r$ which we could use to train the model. One way to solve this problem is by using sensitivity equations. This approach will be discussed in the following."
